Positional Arguments
====================

:path:     
         path to newroot
:command:  
         Optional command to run.
         
         Similar to chroot(1), if unspecified this defaults to $SHELL from the
         host environment and if that's unset it executes /bin/sh.

Base Options
============

-h, --help  
            Show this help message and exit. To get more
            information see the related man page.

--version   
            Show this program's version information and exit.
            
            When running from within a git repo or a version
            installed from git the latest commit hash and date will
            be shown.

Chroot Options
==============

--no-mounts                             
                                        Disable the default bind mounts which can be used to obtain a standard
                                        chroot environment that you'd expect when using chroot(1).

--hostname HOSTNAME                     
                                        Specify the chroot hostname. In order to set the domain name as well,
                                        pass an FQDN instead of a singular hostname.

--skip-chdir                            
                                        Do not change the current working directory to '/'.
                                        
                                        Unlike chroot(1), this currently doesn't limit you to only using it
                                        when the new root isn't '/'. In other words, you can use a new chroot
                                        environment on the current host system rootfs with one caveat: any
                                        absolute paths will use the new rootfs.

-B SRC[:DEST], --bind SRC[:DEST]        
                                        Specify a custom bind mount.
                                        
                                        In order to mount the same source to multiple destinations, use the
                                        SRC:DEST syntax. For example, the following will bind mount '/srv/data'
                                        to /srv/data and /home/user/data in the chroot::
                                        
                                            pychroot -B /srv/data -B /srv/data:/home/user/data /path/to/chroot

-R SRC[:DEST], --rbind SRC[:DEST]       
                                        specify custom recursive bind mount

--ro SRC[:DEST], --readonly SRC[:DEST]  
                                        Specify a custom readonly bind mount.
                                        
                                        Readonly, recursive bind mounts aren't currently supported on Linux so
                                        this has to be a standalone option for now. Once they are, support for
                                        them and other mount attributes will be added as an extension to the
                                        mount point argument syntax.
