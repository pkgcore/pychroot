Description
===========

pychroot is an extended **chroot(1)** equivalent that also provides support for
automatically handling bind mounts. By default, the proc and sysfs filesystems
are mounted to their respective /proc and /sys locations inside the chroot as
well as bind mounting /dev and /etc/resolv.conf from the host system.

In addition to the defaults, the user is able to specify custom bind mounts.
For example, the following command will recursively bind mount the user's home
directory at the same location inside the chroot directory::

pychroot -R /home/user ~/chroot

This allows a user to easily set up a custom chroot environment without having
to resort to scripted mount handling or other methods.
